#Templates

Templates are examples of scripts or configuration files. They are not intended to be edited in place, since the changes will be pushed to the central git repo.

Instead, copy any configuration file to the /admin folder before use. Copy any other script to the 'adhoc' folder before use. There you can edit them all you want without having to worry whether the changes will be pushed to the central repo.
